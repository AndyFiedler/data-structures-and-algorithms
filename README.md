code challenge eight:
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

code challenge 11:
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

code challenge 12:
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.
